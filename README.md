## Predicting survival of passengers on the Titanic dataset
The aim of this project was to get acquainted with the tools, learn about the different data structures (NumPy Arrays, Series and DataFrames) how they work and what they offer,and practice the key steps on the whole data analysis process.In this project I Explored the dataset containing information about Titanic passengers by using NumPy and Pandas, which are two popular Python packages used for manipulating datasets. 

I used Decision tree & Random forest algorithms to predict the percentage of passengers who survived.
I am currently at 1304th rank for the given competition on Kaggle with an accuracy score of 79.90%.
